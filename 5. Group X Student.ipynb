    "# Goals for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned in class, when handeling large data sets, matching them, and eventually merging them is important to quickly and efficiently analyze and study data sets. In this project, we will be working with three large data sets that contain the star members of the young cluster 'Group X'. Professor Newton's work shows that this cluster is about 300 Myr old, and that one of the stars (TOI 2048) in the cluster hosts an exoplanet. Here, we'll look athe stars in the cluster. We will download these data sets from the archive, compare these archives against each other using the pandas merge function and by plotting the contents of each. "

To enable this, we will need columns that tell us whether a star was in each dataset. So, let's add a column to each data table as an identifier for what study they originally belonged to. For example, I recommend adding in a column to the dataframe for the Tang et al. study called `tang` and set it equal to \"True\" for every object. "
