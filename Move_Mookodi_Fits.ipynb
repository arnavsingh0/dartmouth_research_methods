    "# Move Mookodi FITS files to subdirectories prior to running pipeline\n",
    "The TEA-Phot.py pipeline assumes that flats, biases and science images are all in separate directories.  This code creates subdirectories (sub-folders) of the current folder, and using the contents of the headers, automacitally moves the fits files into separate folders, in preparation for running TEA-phot.py.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "First we create some sub-folders.  Note that on a Mac, folders start with a \"/\", while I am fairly sure on a Windows machine they start with a \"\\\" .  Hence we have to use the Pathlib library in order to get the path. This library will automatically use \"\\\\\" on Windows computers, and \"/\" on Macs. I have not tested this on a Windows computer, and just trusting the documentation for Pathlib."
